# sno-manager
CLI interface for managing installs and upgrades of Single Node Openshift (SNO) clusters

This CLI is based on the Openshift [ib-orchestrate-vm](https://github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ib-orchestrate-vm) and [bip-orchestrate-vm](https://github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/bip-orchestrate-vm) repositories and has the primary goal of combining the functionality of those repositories into one useful cli.
